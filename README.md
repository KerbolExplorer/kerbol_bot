Basic multipurpose discord bot. Has several command categories such as games, misc, a level system and a couple commands useful for aviation enthusiasts.
In order to run you'd need the bot token, in order to run the bot your user id. Your id is needed since on_app_command_error and morning call so the bot can dm you errors and greet you in the mornings (I'm weird ik). By default the bot loads these variables as envirorment variables (They go on a .env file).

You are free to use this code as you need. But I kindly ask you to change it a bit so it's at least unique to your own.
